# NextGenTheremin
A Theremin for the 21st century

>We choose to ~go to the moon~ *make a theremin* in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are ~hard~ *reasonably challenging*, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to ~win~ *learn from*, and the others, too.
      - (mostly) John F. Kennedy
