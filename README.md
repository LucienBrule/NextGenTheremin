# NextGenTheremin
##*A Theremin for the 21st century*

>We choose to ~~go to the moon~~ *make a theremin* in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are ~~hard~~ *reasonably challenging*, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to ~~win~~ *learn from*, and the others, too.

This is my first project developed by me at the [BOSTONHACKS](https://bostonhacks.io/) Hackathon, an [MLH](https://mlh.io/) event on Halloween 2015.

##How to run/develop:
  * ~~\<if BostonHacks is still going on, join the team\>~~
  * **Install the dependencies**:
      * [Get the Leap Motion API/service](https://developer.leapmotion.com/):
        * The library is included in ```\lib``` as an example and ```\fullib``` contains libs for all targets
        * Depending on your target you'll need some combo of what's in the lib folder.    
      * [Get PyAudio](https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/)
      * [Get PyGame](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml)
      * [Get Numpy](http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html)
  * Add something, anything! 
  * Submit a pull request
  
## What we need:
* Design
* Programming
* Musical demos
* Anything!
